# Flexible Job-shop Instances

This repository contains instances of the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP).

WARNING! Data may not be accurate. If you find an error, please report an issue. Always refer to the original paper.

## Instances

Description in [instances.json](instances.json).

- `brandimarte` (15 instances from [1])
- `hurink` (3 × 66 instances from [2])
- `dauzere` (18 instances from [3])
- `barnes` (21 instances from [4])
- `kacem` (4 instances from [5])
- `fattahi` (20 instances from [6])
- `behnke` (60 instances from [7])

Data about bounds are from [7] and [8].

## Format

- First line: `<number of jobs> <number of machines>`
- Then one line per job: `<number of operations>` and then, for each operation, `<number of machines for this operation>` and for each machine, a pair `<machine> <processing time>`.
- Machine index starts at 0.
